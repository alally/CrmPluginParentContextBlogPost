# Dynamics CRM Plug-in Execution Context Blog Post
This project contains samples that go along with my Dynamics CRM Plug-in Execution Context blog post I wrote. In order to get it working simply checkout the code, build, and use the CRM Plug-in Registration Utility to register the plug-in and add the appropriate steps. 

This is code is only for demonstration purposes. The requirements used to create the plug-in were made up by me and I have no idea if it is a an actual business need. If it is for you and you decide to use the code, please do your own testing. This is demo code for a blog post so I did not do extensive testing.
